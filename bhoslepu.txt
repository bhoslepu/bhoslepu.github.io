<p>About Me

Hi, I’m Prashant Bhosale — a Lead Systems & Cloud DevOps Engineer with 15+ years of expertise in Cloud Architecture, DevOps, and Security, driving innovation, scalability, and operational excellence across diverse industries.

I specialize in designing, architecting, and securing cloud environments (AWS, GCP, OCI) with automation-first strategies. My career spans from hands-on system administration to platform engineering, delivering resilient, secure, and cost-efficient solutions that enable faster releases and seamless scaling.

Recognized for problem-solving, analytical thinking, and a growth mindset, I thrive on complex challenges, never settling for “good enough.” My results speak for themselves—like improving team productivity by 20%, accelerating release cycles by 50%, and ensuring 99.9% uptime in high-stakes production environments.
